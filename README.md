# Fake News Detection System Using LinearSVC Algorithm 

A machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real. It uses Scikit-learn's LinearSVC algorithm trained on TF-IDF vectorized text. The model's accuracy is evaluated, and its predictions are compared against actual labels, highlighting instances of false positives and negatives with a confusion matrix.
